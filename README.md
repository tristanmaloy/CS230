Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platform that is based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It. The game is currently only on Android and should work cross platform while supporting multiple teams and players. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I did well with the research aspect specifically when we were comparing the different OS and the server-side, client-side, and development tools. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document was a good way to keep things organized and a good way to communicate potential risks, design constraints, work arounds, and solutions.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise my design constraints, now that I know more about security, authorization, and authentication. I can apply that knowledge to have better design constraints. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Ultimately the satisfaction of the user is the main goal. A satisfied user makes for a happy client. The users will be more inclined to user future applications from the client if their needs are listened to.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Pointing out the needs and requirements from the client is essential in designing software. Once that is determined, aspects such as the different supported OS and their specific requirements must be addressed. The architectural patters are definitely things I will be utilizing in future classes and projects. There were times during the coding assignments that I could not get my IDE to work, however I communicated with my professor and also received aid from other students who have previously taken the class. That being said, reaching out for support is always a good strategy when necessary.
